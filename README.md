# UGNCL: Uncertainty-Guided Noisy Correspondence Learning for Effective Cross-Modal Matching

The pytorch implementation of UGNCL: Uncertainty-Guided Noisy Correspondence Learning for Effective Cross-Modal Matching

We referred to the implementations of [NCR](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2021-NeurIPS-NCR) and [DECL](https://github.com/QinYang79/DECL) to build up our codebase.
